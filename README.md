# COVID-19 Analytics: Leveraging SQL and Power BI for Data-Driven Insights - Part 1

## Description
This repository contains the SQL queries and related analyses for the COVID-19 Analytics project. The project uses SQL to derive actionable insights from COVID-19 data, focusing on case trends, vaccination rates, and mortality rates. This project leverages SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization to analyze COVID-19 data. The focus is on uncovering trends in infection rates, vaccination progress, and mortality across regions. Inspired by a project by Alex the Analyst, this analysis employs unique SQL queries and visualizations, demonstrating how different techniques can reveal critical insights.

## Project Structure
