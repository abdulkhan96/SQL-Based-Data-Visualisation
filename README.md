# COVID-19 Analytics: Leveraging SQL and Power BI for Data-Driven Insights

## Description
This repository contains the SQL queries and related analyses for the [COVID-19 Analytics project](https://medium.com/@abdul.khan96/covid-19-analytics-leveraging-sql-and-power-bi-for-data-driven-insights-part-1-23eb99c38156). The project uses SQL to derive actionable insights from COVID-19 data, focusing on case trends, vaccination rates, and mortality rates. This project leverages SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization to analyze COVID-19 data. The focus is on uncovering trends in infection rates, vaccination progress, and mortality across regions. Inspired by a project by Alex the Analyst, this analysis employs unique SQL queries and visualizations, demonstrating how different techniques can reveal critical insights.

## Project Structure
- [`COVID-19_Analysis.sql`](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/Covid%20SQL%20Project.sql): SQL queries used for data analysis.
- [`README.md`](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/README.md): This file with project details.

## Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Deaths Data**: Includes columns such as ISO code, location, continent, total deaths, new deaths, etc.
- **COVID-19 Vaccinations Data**: Includes columns such as ISO code, location, continent, total vaccinations, new vaccinations, etc.

## SQL Queries
This project includes a collection of SQL queries used for analyzing COVID-19 data, such as:
- Mortality rate calculation
- New cases and deaths trends
- Vaccination rate trends

## Results
Overall, these findings underscore the complexity of the pandemicâ€™s impact, illustrating the varied responses and outcomes across different regions. The data emphasizes the importance of continued monitoring and analysis to guide effective pandemic management and response strategies.
