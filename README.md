![COVID-19 Visualization](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/Image_y3lu1cy3lu1cy3lu.jpeg)

## Description
This repository contains the SQL queries and related analyses for the COVID-19 Analytics project. The project uses SQL to derive actionable insights from COVID-19 data, focusing on case trends, vaccination rates, and mortality rates. This project leverages SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization to analyze COVID-19 data. The focus is on uncovering trends in infection rates, vaccination progress, and mortality across regions. Inspired by a project by Alex the Analyst, this analysis employs unique SQL queries and visualizations, demonstrating how different techniques can reveal critical insights.

## Following are the parts of the project:

## Project Structure
- [`COVID-19_Analysis.sql`](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/Covid%20SQL%20Project.sql): SQL queries used for data analysis.
- [`README.md`](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/README.md): This file with project details.

## Data Sources
- **[COVID-19 Deaths Data](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/CovidDeaths.csv)**: Includes columns such as ISO code, location, continent, total deaths, new deaths, etc.
- **[COVID-19 Vaccinations Data](https://github.com/abdulkhan96/SQL-Based-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.csv)**: Includes columns such as ISO code, location, continent, total vaccinations, new vaccinations, etc.

## SQL Queries
This project includes a collection of SQL queries used for analyzing COVID-19 data, such as:
- Mortality rate calculation
- New cases and deaths trends
- Vaccination rate trends

## Results
This project has provided a detailed exploration of COVID-19 data through SQL queries and Power BI visualizations. By leveraging key metrics such as infection rates, death counts, and vaccination trends, we’ve been able to create a comprehensive dashboard that offers valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic.

Through the visualizations, we’ve highlighted critical trends across different continents and countries, helping to better understand the dynamics of the pandemic. The use of tooltips and dynamic charts further enhances the interactivity and depth of the analysis, making it easier for users to gain meaningful insights.
